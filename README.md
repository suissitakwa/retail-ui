# Retail UI — React Frontend

Frontend application for the **Retail Platform**, built to consume and interact with the Retail Backend APIs.

This repository focuses purely on **frontend concerns** (UI, state management, API integration), while backend logic, messaging, payments, and infrastructure automation live in separate repositories.

**Backend API:** https://github.com/suissitakwa/retail  
**Infrastructure / CD:** https://github.com/suissitakwa/retail-infra  
**Portfolio:** https://portfolio-showcase--suissitakwa.replit.app

## Purpose

The Retail UI demonstrates how a modern frontend integrates with a cloud-native backend:
- consumes REST APIs exposed by Spring Boot services
- interacts with backend-managed features such as caching, messaging, and payments
- remains decoupled from infrastructure and delivery concerns

This separation reflects how frontend and backend teams collaborate in real production environments.
